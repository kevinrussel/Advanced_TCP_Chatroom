This is an advanced TCP chatroom that I am creating.


This program shall have a few advanced funcitonailty that our simple tcp chatroom did not. 


### It will have
1)  Clients able to connect
2) Server asks for username 
3) Be able to handle multi client
4) Clients should be able to disconnect
5) You can also sign into admin mode
6) If user signs into admin mode, they are prompted for password
7) If the password is incorrect, the user is disconnected
8) If the user submits the right password they are able to /kick or /ban any user
9) If the user doesn't exist it says "sorry that user is not in this session
10) If a user gets kicked, they will have to reconnect
11) If the user get's /banned, they can't sign in with the same nickname. 




So this is what I am thinking of doing: So I will be using the old TCP chat room code as the base of where I am going with this, the first step is to create an admin account. Maybe I should also be echoing it on the server.
